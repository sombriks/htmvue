# [htmvue][repo]

Collection of vue directives implementing the htmx specification.

Hypermedia and reactivity strong together.

## Why ???

Why not?

## Vue directives

- [docs here][vue-directive]

## Htmx (same thing)

- [docs here][htmx-docs]

## Noteworthy

HTMX philosophy goes beyond the framework idea. It's a fair, reasonable html
spec extension, htmx is a protocol.

So let's see how fun can it be to offer other implementations of the same thing.

## Roadmap

- under construction
